I'm so glad you're willing to take my suggestions on board.

So, hear me out here, right? We're going to go for the Alan Turing angle, yeah? Y'know the Alan Turing Memorial by Canal St? Well, I was eating lunch down there earlier, and BOOM, brainwave.

So, if you get a photographer on call, I'll call William and convince him to take a walk down there. We can do it during lunch even. Sit him down next to the Turing statue, then the title would be like..."LIGHTING STRIKES TWICE! Turing and Turnell, two Gods of computing!" And they're both Manchester-related! What a fucking headline!!!

PS: William is straight. Please be sure you represent him as such.
