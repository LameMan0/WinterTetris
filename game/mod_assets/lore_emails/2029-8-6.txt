TELL ME ABOUT IT. I hate that most of my job is just shutting down accusations made by VXP. It's like these assholes watched Black Mirror once and thought they were living it. It's pathetic really.

Oh you see that one twat who got arrested a few weeks ago? Yeah, and the Sun reported he was a massive white supremacist loner? Twas the work of moi. ;)
