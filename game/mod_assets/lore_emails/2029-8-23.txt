Robert,

I think we need to have a chat about Jeremy. As skilled and (begrudgingly, I say) integral to Wintermute as he is, I fear he's getting a little too friendly with the idiots in your department. Sending homemade kid's games to placate the ADHD-riddled messes in QA and inviting them to the pub with us?? I had to sit through **THREE HOURS** of Clive talking about fucking Doki Doki, like I haven't already made that piece of shit my life's work!

And to put it bluntly, I do not trust him with the sensitive information that this project's origins are privy to. If he were to - God forbid - leak it to someone below, even (especially, knowing him) accidentally? Not only would the company go up in flames, but they'd lock us all up and throw away the key.

REIGN HIM IN, or I will speak to Michael and have him removed from the Wintermute team, no matter the delays it'd cause.

Greg
