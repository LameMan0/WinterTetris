SUBJECT: Team Salvato Meeting


Hi Fiona, hope this finds you well.

In case you haven't been made aware, Louis has scheduled a meeting for us two with Tom Batterman, Team Salvato's legal guy, because TS wants to renegotiate how much of the profits they get from Wintermute. Meet's at 12:30pm tomorrow, and I've arranged us to meet at the Zizzi's by Piccadilly Gardens. Please ring me when you see this!!
