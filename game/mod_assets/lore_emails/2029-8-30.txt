Paul, think. It doesn't matter if I incriminate myself any more than I already have. If VXP have got *everything*, this inquiry will slaughter the company AND everyone involved. And I'm not talking Grenfell fines here, I'm talking serious prison time. You just need to be puppet CEO until the inquiry's over. (and it will be over - I'm in active communication with Lord Golding).

I'll be out of the country this time next week. Venezuela, on Louis' suggestion, as it has no extradition treaties.
Jasmine, the kids and I will be safe there. (well, as safe as you can be in Venezuela)
It's been a pleasure working with you. God speed.

William J. Turnell
CEO of Turnell Technologies
