Dom, are those numbers legit? Holy crow, we're rolling if that's the case.

I can see the big potential for Wintermute to take off. Virtual girlfriends, who'd have thought huh? If those charts are accurate, man, it's going to be wicked lucrative.

Hell, maybe we can use this stuff for virtual pets. Wont die on you or anything. Potential huge market right there for veterans with the support dogs, right? Get us some brownie points with the NHS, big opportunity for the States? Just a spitball.
