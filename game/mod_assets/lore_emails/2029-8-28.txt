SUBJECT: DEBRIEF REPORT FOR SPECIMEN BD-G


I've received word from Field Group G that Specimen BD-G has passed as of last week. His family will be notified - a story will be fabricated.

We are still due twelve more neural samples scanned in the week before Specimen BD-G passed. But largely, this marks the end of our "G" specimen testing after four long years of work. Unfortunate, given the veracity and efficiency that resulted from this test group.

From now, our work will pivot to "J" specimens (MHA-1983). The DoO in Field Group J finally received the shipment of ArSynL Probing Tools, so we're due scans from Specimen LD-J, BQ-J and PB-J in the coming days.

On a personal note, I'd just like to congratulate everyone for the fantastic work you've been doing. I know it's been tough recently, with all the worries that external parties would discover our work, but Illeana & the other folks at Comms has done a fantastic job at keeping everything underground. This department would be nothing without each and every one of you, so keep up the good work!
