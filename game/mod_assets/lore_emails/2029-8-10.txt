SUBJECT: Henry update


Hannah,

Just so you know, Henry is no longer with the company. You and Vivi will have to pick up that workload until we can get a replacement. I'll start interviewing ASAP.

From what I heard, mentioning VXP is going to be verboten in future emails, once those guys over in Dev get off their asses with the anime girl project. Consider that a heads-up, and to keep yours down.

Unrelated, but want to come over tonight? Amy is hosting a little get-together while the boys are on a school trip. There's wine!
