Hey guys, an update about that big software bug:

-- From my research, apparently it can only happen IF done purposefully by deliberately crashing the error checking engine with a stack overflow. While it could happen otherwise, I don't see how.
-- I was able to grab a quick meeting with OPSEC, then a meeting with the CIO, then a report to the board chair. Simply put: their opinion is that the effort to fix it would be better served by just finishing the product. Once it ships, we'll have time to address it.

I don't like it either since we could lose all our work in an instant, but since fixing it requires almost a complete re-write of our error handling, it'll take us weeks, and that's apparently unacceptable.

Sorry mates.
