SUBJECT: Considerations due to recent news


Hi Louis! I've just had a big talk with Dan, Lisa and the others here at TS. And unfortunately, we've had to make a really tough decision.

With respect to yourself and everyone else we've talked to at Turnell Technologies, no amount of money is worth sleepwalking into the reputational black hole that Turnell currently finds itself in, and we'd like to pull out of the proposed Wintermute project with immediate effect.

Thank you so much for all you've done for us, but continued association with Turnell Technologies in light of recent news would reflect poorly on Team Salvato, and we'd like to avoid carrying that baggage.

Thanks for understanding.
