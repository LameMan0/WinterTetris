SUBJECT: Availability for interview re: NYC donations?


Hello, William! Liam Winchester here, I'm a writer/interviewer at BBC News (working Tech news specifically).

I was wondering if you'd be up for an interview with myself?
It's for an upcoming piece I'm writing to commemmorate your recent milestone of Â£100m donated to victims of the NYC anthrax attacks.
If I could just get a few quick comments that would be fantastic!!
Please get back to me when you're able

Liam
